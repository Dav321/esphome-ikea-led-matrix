# esphome-frekvens-component

A custom component for esp-home to interface with IKEA's Frekvens Cube.

## Sources

This repo is heavily based on the original [FrekvensPanel library by @frumperino][https://github.com/frumperino/FrekvensPanel].

It's also inspired from the esphome component PCD8544.

## Usage

Currently there is a dependency upon Adafruit GFX library. In your esphome config, add these lines:

- Declare necessary libraries
- Define frekvenspanel component

## License
[TBD] the original library does not specify the license. This repo is consecutively not licensed yet either.
